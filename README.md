# DMark_1.1

I am pleased to welcome you to my website for convenient bookmarks.  

My idea came to me after I completed an assignment for a course from GoIteens. Namely, to improve the user experience with bookmarks, because everything is quite inconvenient in the browser and I always get lost in them because I have so many. My mini-project will help those who live in bookmarks, especially programmers. It is always necessary to have all the tools at hand and not to search for them multiple times. I would also be delighted if you tried my project, even if you are not a programmer. I would be very happy if it helps people and they like it. 

One of the advantages of my site is that it does not require registration and keeps your data as secure as possible. 

Currently, my application is version - 1.1, but there will soon be an update that will allow you to import your bookmarks so that in the future, if you change your device, you can still access your bookmarks. 

Soon, I will add instructions on how to customise the website, which you will find in the README.md file.
