DMark_1.1: The Developer's Bookmark Manager

I'm pleased to welcome you to my website for convenient and organized bookmarks.

The idea for this project was born after I completed an assignment for a course at GoIteens. I realized that the user experience with native browser bookmarks is often inconvenient and cluttered. My mini-project, DMark_1.1, is designed to solve this problem by helping users, especially programmers, keep all their tools quickly accessible and organized. I would be delighted if you tried the project, regardless of your background.

Key Advantages and Confidentiality

My application offers a high degree of privacy: it does not require registration and stores all your data locally on your device (in localStorage), ensuring maximum confidentiality and security from third-party servers.

Development Status and Roadmap

The current version of the application is v. 1.0.6.

I am actively working on the next minor update, v. 1.1.0, which will introduce a crucial feature: the ability to import and export your bookmarks. This will allow you to easily back up and transfer your data between devices.
